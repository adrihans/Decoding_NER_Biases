# Decoding_NER_Biases

This repository is used for a Sciences Po group project for the course 'Decoding Biases in AI'.

We want to explore the existing biases in NER models. 

Those biases can be based on :
- Gender
- Ethnicity
- Area for city names
- ...

The main goal is to analyze those biases through several datasets and tests. 

The main inspiration for this project comes from [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03415.pdf).

## Gender and Ethnicity biases when applying a NER model on first names:

## Location biases when applying a NER model on city names -given the country or the continent:
